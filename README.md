README-Generator-SW

Sarah Wist


A readme file is a valuable piece of any adequate project.  The readme contains contains necessary instructions on how to run an application, as well as provides useful details pertaining to it's creation.  In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a readme generator that could dynamically create a readme file by executing executing commands in the terminal using node.js.  To do so, we needed to install a JSON package and axios, as well as have an API key for GitHub.  

This past week, the class learned about Node, it's uses, and how to apply it in our homework.  In addition, we learned about await functions and asynchronous functions.  These functions, along with NPM and axios, are what allow the program to dynamically create a readme.md file.  It is crucial to have this .md file alongside the files containing the actual code.  Not only is it best practice in the industry, but it allows others to understand how to use your app, why it was necessary to create, and let's others build off of what was originally deployed in future iterations.

This assignment was an excellent example of what is possible by using node in the command line and how we as future developers can build, test, and run our future projects outside of the browser.
